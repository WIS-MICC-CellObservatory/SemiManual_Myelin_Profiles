Instructions for the Second step for semi-manual g-ratio quantification which is outline here:
 
1) Open the image , run "CountMayelinatedAxons.ijm"  macro 
	  It will ask you to draw a line along the scalebar, and select the relavant part of the image for analysis and  
 	  will find candidates of inner part of the mayelinated axons
 	  
2) Open the image , drag and drop the FILINMAE_InnerRoiSet.zip file into Fiji 
    Draw the outer parts of the malinated axon and add them to the RoiManager (see details below)
    There may be  non-relevant detections, Don't bother to delete them, 
    as the next step will include only matched pairs of inner&outer ROIs
    Save the ROI file when done (see ManualEditingInstructions_ForGRatio.txt)
    
3) Open the image, run the "GratioOfManualOuter_MayelinatedAxons.ijm" macro
    it will open the Roi file from step 2, find pairs of inner/outer ROIs and for each pair calculate the g-ratio


Adding Inner ROIS
==================
You can simply use any of the drawing tools to draw a ROI around the mayelinated axon
once you have done press 't' on the keyboard or click "Add" in the RoiManger 

The Wand tool can be very useful for selecting the Inner parts
Edit=>Selection=>Interpolate can help to smooth the selection
Brush tool can help for fine tuning of existing selection or for full selection

Once you added the Roi to the RoiManager, "Rename" it so it will start with "I-" 
- Otherwise it will be discarded in the next step

Updating Inner ROIS
====================
To SELECT a ROI you can either:
- highlight it in the RoiManager
- "Show All" Rois from the Roi Manager, and in the image window long left-click (few seconds) inside the Roi

Once the Roi is selected , you can CHANGE it in several ways, eg: 
- Use the brush Tool, if you start from inside the Roi - you enlarge it, 
  if you start from outside you remove parts of the Roi

When done, click "UPDATE" in the RoiManger, this will replace the Roi with the new corrected selection

Deleting Inner ROIS
====================
You can delete Inner Roi by selecting it and then clicking "Delete" from RoiManager
However, usualy you don't need to bother doing it as measurement is done only 
using mayelinated axons that have matching pair of Inner and Outer Rois. 
Inner Roi's that dont have matching Outer Roi, are discarded by the following macro

Adding Outer ROIS
==================
You can simply use any of the drawing tools to draw a ROI around the mayelinated axon
once you have done press 't' on the keyboard or click "Add" in the RoiManger 

If the mayelin is of homogeneous thickness, you can select the inner Roi and expand it by the thickness. 
to do this it will be easier to change the image (just for the manual editing) 
to be in pixel units by: Analyze=>Set Scale=>Click to remove Scale
You can measure the thickness using the line tool, you'll see the thickness in the Fiji  window (length value)
to expand the Roi use: Edit=>Selection=>Enlarge

Saving the file
================
for an image named: FileName.tif
- From RoiManager: click "Deselect"
- From RoiManager: click "More" => "Save", save the file into Results\FileName_InnerOuterRoiSet.zip
